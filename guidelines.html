		<h2>Contributing</h2>

		<p lang="en-gb">We are open for new issues and pull requests. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our <a href="https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus/blob/master/gusbemacbe/suru-plus/blob/master/LICENSE">licence</a>.</p>

		<p lang="en-gb">If you would like to contribute and don't understand something here, reach out on our issue, and we will be happy to offer solutions. Additionally, we welcome any attempts to engage with the project – through acquiring the source code, following documentation steps to get started, and then offering feedback in our communications channels on how this process could be improved.</p>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

		<h4 class="h3">Fork and Clone</h4>

		<p lang="en-gb" class="paragraph">Fork our repository and create a clone to your personal system.</p>
		
		<h4>Branches</h4>

		<p lang="en-gb">After forking our repository, create one branch per bugs or per files or per icons on your personal repository.</p>

		<p lang="en-gb">The branch name should describe the bug or version ("<code>alpha</code>" or "<code>beta</code>" or "<code>new-icons</code>" or "<code>unstable</code>" or "<code>beta-emergency</code>" or "<code>unstable-emergency</code>"). It should start with the bug or version number, and include a very short description of the bug, or a short version of the bug's title.</p>

		<h3>Developing</h3>
		
		<p lang="en-gb" class="paragraph">I recommend the vector editors:</p>

		<ul class="paragraph">
			<li>Affinity Designer</li>
			<li>Figma</li>
			<li>Inkscape</li>
			<li>Sketch</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Attention!</h4>

		<ul>
			<li lang="en-gb">I do not recommend Gravit Designer because it does not respect the standard SVG, for example, it uses RGB, and we depend extremely on the hexadecimal codes, which must be useful to be replaced with Arrongin and Telinkrin colours.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">When you save the file in Inkscape, export as plain and optimised SVG instead, because the Inkscape SVG file contains numberless dirty codes, what keeps you out of opening with other vector editors</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">Although you prefer another desktop environment, I recommend to use KDE for test to check if the icon seems good or not on KDE.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Affinity Deisgner, Figma and Sketch</h4>

		<p lang="en-gb">We have provided three templates of Suru++ big icon, each one for Affinity Designer, Figma and Sketch. EXporting all to SVG is required.</p>

		<ul>Also make two monochromatic and small icons:
			<li lang="en-gb">One for the folder <code>16</code> with the colour <code class="code-alt">#5c616c</code>.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">Another for the symbolic icon with the suffix <code>-symbolic</code>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Be careful!</h5>

		<p lang="en-gb">If you do not want to use KDE for test, it is important to observe that not all the features of an icon are supported in the KDE environment. Here are the unsupported features:</p>

		<ul>
			<li lang="en-gb">Blur (duplicate the shape, apply the blur effect to it and send backward from to the original shape)</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">Drop shadow blur (use the natural drop shadow in the shape)</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">Inner shadow blur (use the natural inner shadow in the shape)</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">Masks (instead, cut with intersection or vectorise all the objects/shapes)</li>
		</ul>

		<p lang="en-gb"> <code class="code-alt">&#x1F4A1;</code> You can use the cloned blurry shape as a drop shadow, then just apply 40% of opacity and add 4 pixels of shape position <a>y</a>.</p>

			<p lang="en-gn">You must follow the rules of colours and grids of Sam Hewitt's <a href="https://snwh.org/suru/guidelines">Suru Design Guideline</a>:</p>

			<ul>
				<li lang="en-gb"><b>Solid colours:</b> As for Suru++ 25, prefer the bright and vivid colours of Sam Hewitt's orginial Suru plaette</li>
				<li lang="en-gb"><b>Gradient colours:</b>We have provided a Suru++ gradients swatches for Affinity Designer, Figma and Sketch. Observe that Inkscape does not support gradient swatches, then we have provided a SVG file of palettes.</li>
				<li lang="en-gb"><b>Grids:</b> A symbol must be resized to 145px and if it is a symbol in form of circle grid or the symbol seems too small for you, use 165px.</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>Colours palette</h4>

		<p lang="en-gb">These normal gradient colours are based on the original colours palette of Sam Hewitt's Suru icons, but gave a new elegant, futuristic and modern colours scheme. Inspired by cyberpunk neon colours:</p>

    <div class="container-colours-sets" id="normal-colours"></div>

		<h5>Medium colours</h5>

		<p lang="en-gb">The red colours are inspired by by the TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon_(TV_series)">Altered Carbon</a> and the cyan, golden, turquoise and orange by the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner">Blade Runner</a>. They can be used on anything, anywhere, in any combination that works, but ideal with bright and white background or foreground.</p>

    <div class="container-colours-sets" id="medium-colours"></div>

		<h5>Bright colours</h5>

		<p lang="en-gb">These bright colours are inspired by the lightsabers of the scifi series Star Wars, and by neon lights at night. They can be used on anything, anywhere, in any combination that works. Like their use in the Star Wars family of film and TV shows, they are ideal with a dark background or foreground.</p>

    <div class="container-colours-sets" id="bright-colours"></div>

		<h5>Purely cyberpunk colours</h5>

		<p lang="en-gb">These are purely cyberpunk colours, extracted from the 90s successful Belgian electronic music Technotronic, which marked the new era of the cyberpunk world, with the cyberpunk music genres as dance-pop, electro, euro disco, italo disco and techno, from the films Blade Runner and from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy">TRON: Legacy</a>, and from the TV series Altered Carbon, Star Trek and Star Wars.</p>

		<ul>
			<li lang="en-g">The gradient colour <span class="colour" style="background: var(--firefox)"></span> is based on new Firefox browser icon. </li>
			<li lang="en-g">The gradient colour <span class="colour" style="background: var(--firefox-focus)"></span> is based on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/mobile/#focus">Firefox Focus browser</a> and on the original <a href="https://github.com/Bonandry/suru-plus">@Bonandry</a>'s Suru++ Ubuntu icons theme. </li>
			<li lang="en-g">The gradient colour <span class="colour" style="background: var(--haguichi)"></span> is based on the Haguichi icon restyled for Sam Hewitt's Suru icons theme. </li>
			<li lang="en-gb">The gradient colour <span class="colour" style="background: var(--kamera)"></span> is inspired by the Kamera icon, a KDE app.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">The gradient colour <span class="colour" style="background: var(--mavericks)"></span> is inspired by the Mavericks wallpaper, used in macOS 10.9 and was one of official colours of Suru++ in the version 20.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">The gradient colour <span class="colour" style="background: var(--mint)"></span> is a colour of Linux Mint.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">The gradient colours <span class="colour" style="background: var(--css-tricks)"></span> and <span class="colour" style="background: var(--fitdance)"></span> are inspired by the Brazilian dance fitness, FitDance, leaded by ex-Big Brother of Brazil, Diego Pretto. This dance fitness practices the 80s and 90s dance genres, which symbolise the cyberpunkism.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">The gradient colours <span class="colour" style="background: var(--90stechnotronic1)"></span>, 
																						<span class="colour" style="background: var(--90stechnotronic2)"></span>, 
																						<span class="colour" style="background: var(--90stechnotronic3)"></span> and 
																						<span class="colour" style="background: var(--90stechnotronic4)"></span> are based on 90s Technotronic.</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="container-colours-sets" id="cyberpunk-colours"></div>

		<h5>White colours</h5>

		<p lang="en-gb">These futuristic colours are inspired mainly by the TV series Altered Carbon, which features mostly whites in its futuristic laboratories, <i>art deco</i> architecture, and clothes of wealthy meths. Five of them (brown shades) by the film Blade Runner.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li lang="en-gb">If the icon or symbol is dark, the background will be painted with one of these colours.</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">If the background is dark, the icon or symbol will be painted with one of these colours.</li>

		<h3>Commit messages</h3>

		<p lang="en-gn">Commit messages should generally follow <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">this helpful advice</a>, but please start your commit message with:</p>

		<ul>
			<li lang="en-gb">"Added [name of icon] icon" if it is only an icon</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">"Added [number of icons] icons" if it is more than icons</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">"Fixes #nn:" if it is a bug</li>
			<li lang="en-gb">"Improved ##nn" if it is an improvement of a file or an icon</li>
		</ul>

		<p lang="en-gb">It eases skimming history later. For this reason, the first line will tend to be longer than the 50 chars suggested in that article, aim to keep it less than 72 chars.</p>

		<h3>Submitting the pull request</h3>

		<p>When you submit a pull request, please use the description field to explain in words the overall intention of your changes. A few sentences should be plenty. It is also OK to reuse the commit message, if you included a lot of discussion there.</p>

		<p>At this point you are waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within among one and three days. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.</p>

		<h3>Reviews</h3>

		<p lang="en-gb">We try to avoid landing anything without at least a cursory review. We firstly may analyse your codes, your icons or anything else if they must improve.</p>

		<h3>Merging</h3>

		<p lang="en-gb">When a pull request has passed review, the reviewer generally merges.</p>
