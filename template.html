		<h2>Why Suru++?</h2>

		<p>
			As <a href="https://samuelhewitt.com/">Sam Hewitt</a> has restricted the third party icons in his original project of Suru icons, and as his project is under GPL3, we are allowed to derive and create the project, following his grid rules, but have replaced his original Suru colours palette for a new cyberpunk, futuristic and modern colours palette.
		</p>

		<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>

		<p>Discover new colours palettes, inspired by the original Sam Hewitt's Suru icons project, for creating your own icons with a cyberpunk, futuristic and modern touch. You also will learn to follow the grid rules based on his original project.</p>
